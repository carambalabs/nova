### Cartago file
A `cartago.yml` defines the structure of your project for Apple platforms, decoupling it from Xcode. In a Cartago file you can define things like:
- Source files.
- Type of product *(app, extension, framework...)*
- Test files.
- Dependencies with other cartago projects.

[Nova](https://github.com/carambalabs/nova) is a Swift library that provides tools for **parsing** and **validating** Cartago files.

### Motivation
Cartago files are used by [cartago](https://github.com/carambalabs/cartago), a command line tools that offers:
- Generation of Xcode projects.
- Building without using Xcode.
- ...

2. Open `nova.xcodeproj`

### Example
